Blackjack implementation on Android


This is my second application for Android.

Ported over an old project from CS101 that was done on Processing with Python script.

This is a pretty generic implementation of the classical Blackjack game.

There are three buttons on the left side for the three Blackjack game functions.

The four buttons on the right control the number of money you are betting.

The current bet is display on the upper right corner.

There is a button in the center-top region that lets you reset the money if you run out.
